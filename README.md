**SeqAnalyzer** is a new tool for bioinformatic analysis, combining 3 main functions:

- ***Nucleotide sequence analysis:*** get reversed, complementary, transcribed and other versions of nucleotide sequences.
- ***Protein sequence analysis:*** get the key characteristics of the protein sequences: molecular weight, hydrophobicity, length and more.
- ***FASTQ file filtration:***  filter FASTQ-sequences based on quality, sequence length and GC-content.
- ***Processing of GBK and FASTA files***: convert FASTA file from multiline format to oneline or select genes from GBK file that are adjacent to the genes of interest.

## Installation

To get the tool **SeqAnalyzer** clone the git repository::
```bash
